erl_selenium is an erlang implementation of the selenium remote control protocol


Selenium is a well known test framework for web interface. Through an
external api, you are able to run your tests from any languages. 

Several client libraries existed but I needed one in erlang ... so I did it.

= Compilation = 

* Edit the file erlang_config.rb and update
   ERL_TOP="/usr/local/lib/erlang_R13-B0"
* Execute rake in a shell window

= Installation =

* Put the directory selenium_remote/ebin in your ERL_PATH.

= Usage =
== Simple ==

test () ->
    Session = selenium :start (?HOST,?PORT, ?BROWSER, ?URL),
    Start_url = "http://charpi.net",
    selenium: cmd (Session, open, [Start_url]),
    selenium: stop (Session).

== Selenium API ==

test () ->
    Session = selenium :start (?HOST,?PORT, ?BROWSER, ?URL),
    Start_url = "http://charpi.net",
    selenium_api: open (Session, Start_url),
    selenium: stop (Session).

== Selenium Session ==

test () ->
    Session = selenium :launch_session (?HOST,?PORT, ?BROWSER, ?URL),
    Start_url = "http://charpi.net",
    Session: open (Start_url),
    Session: stop_session ().
